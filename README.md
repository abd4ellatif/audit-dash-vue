Managing an academic institution requires the cohesion of many efforts and the harnessing of many human and material resources in order to make the institution work well in all respects.
The main problem here is whether the process is on the right track or not.

Based on this principle, the 'Higher School of Computer Science 08 May 1945 - Sidi Bel Abbes' has launched a project that aims to collect all information on the institution and produce a data warehouse to extract the basic elements for the social audit.

'audit-dash' is a web application produced by Abdellatif and Ibrahim as part of their final studies project.

The application is implemented as a business intelligence tool and a data wrapper to generate reports on demand of the decision maker and with different graphical representation tools.

Our application has the advantage of giving the decision maker the exact and precise choice of the data he wants to analyze, offering him the details of each analysis module with the possibility to manage different data domains and export them.

And with easy-to-use interfaces displaying clear content and precise results, it is accurate, detailed and well presented in a variety of ways.

Here you will find the interface only.. the rest of the application parts are distributed in the following repositories:
* [ESIAudit (Collect microservice)](https://github.com/dfourcfive/ESIaudit)
* [ESIAudit-BI (Data-integration and BI analysis)](https://github.com/dfourcfive/ESIaudit-BI)
* [ESIAudit-Optimi (For saving results and optimisation)](https://github.com/dfourcfive/ESIAudit-Optimi)

Use this line after loading the code:
> npm i

By default, the server is executed in port 3000
